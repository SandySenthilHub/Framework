# Software Requirement Specification: Enhanced Multi-Tenant Contact Center and Mobile Banking Analytics Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the Enhanced Multi-Tenant Contact Center and Mobile Banking Analytics Platform. This platform is designed to serve X Bank (TenantID=1) and Y Bank (TenantID=2) by integrating advanced Azure Cognitive Services, sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities, fully customizable dashboards for various user roles (Admin, Hameed, Rishi), and a robust React-based frontend. This document will serve as the foundation for the design, development, and testing of the platform, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear and common understanding of the system's functionalities, features, constraints, and goals. The specifications outlined herein aim to be comprehensive, measurable, and unambiguous, facilitating a streamlined development process and a final product that meets the explicit and implicit needs of the end-users and the business objectives of X Bank and Y Bank. The platform will build upon existing functionalities, including a multi-tenant Azure SQL Server backend, a FastAPI-based backend, and Power BI integration, while introducing significant enhancements to analytics, user experience, and operational efficiency.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this project encompasses the enhancement of an existing multi-tenant analytics platform. Key areas of development include the deep integration of Azure Cognitive Services for advanced data processing such as speech-to-text transcription, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, entity recognition, and tone detection for both English and Arabic languages. The platform will incorporate advanced AI and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities, including regression analysis for KPI prediction, clustering for customer and agent segmentation, anomaly detection for identifying outliers in operational data, and the utilization of automated neural networks via Azure AutoML for optimizing predictive models. A significant part of the scope is the development of fully customizable dashboards, allowing users like Admin, Hameed, and Rishi to personalize their data visualization experience through drag-and-drop widgets, configurable filters, and drill-down capabilities, with these customizations persisted in the Azure SQL Server database. Furthermore, the project includes the creation of a responsive and interactive React frontend that will display real-time analytics and integrate seamlessly with Azure Cognitive Services. The backend will be served by FastAPI, and the system will continue to leverage Power BI for reporting, now enhanced with Cognitive Services outputs. The scope also covers the necessary updates to the Azure SQL Server database schema to accommodate new data points from these enhanced services, the refinement of the synthetic data generator, the IVR analytics module, and the existing alerts system. The platform must be scalable to support future integration of internet banking KPIs and adhere to stringent security measures including row-level security and data encryption, despite not requiring initial user authentication for dashboard customization access (user selection via dropdown). Deliverables will include the database schema, FastAPI backend code, React frontend code, Power BI templates, a synthetic data generation script, an MLOps pipeline definition, the alert system specifications, IVR analytics functionalities, and comprehensive Azure deployment instructions.
